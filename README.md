# StructuredLogging

StructuredLogging collects data over HTTP, while your applications use the best available structured logging APIs for your platform. StructuredLogging is a web application hosted on your infrastructure, so you retain complete control over your own data.

Structured logging preserves the individual property values, as well as the text, of each event.
These are sent across the network to StructuredLogging, which displays and makes them searchable:
