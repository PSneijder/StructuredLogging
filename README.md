# StructuredLogging

StructuredLogging collects data over HTTP, while your applications use the best available structured logging APIs for your platform. StructuredLogging is a web application hosted on your infrastructure, so you retain complete control over your own data.

StructuredLogging is a log server that runs on a central machine. Your applications internally write structured events with a framework like Serilog, NLog, log4net.
